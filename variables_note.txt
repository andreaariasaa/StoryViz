TODO: most important: communicate the narrative, then communicate the data to support
we want to see some of the bigger population still. keep track of percentage out of total population?
grey out the dots that don't apply to the question anymore. push them to the side. don't make them disappear.
or different shades for different question, similar shades for questions that are asked in sequence

important questions: income, motivation to stay/leave, desire plan/prepare
if we want to include more questions and can't get to the questions, use static graphs. export image, photoshop, etc as png. doesn't have to be the bubbles

focus on presenting it concisely.
it's ok to include pargraphs of text (like an article)
- maybe have headlines that are bolded. so that we can understand what's going on just with the headlines. the small text is for people who want to read through the details.
- headlines can help us verbally present.

focus our time on our narrative

the filtering tool is an 'extra' in this project. don't need to have a dashboard. enough interactivity can happen with the scrolly.

TODO:
simplification methods:
instead of bubble for each household, a bubble that eats
try to group different choices
filtering on filtering is hard to follow. nested questions is complicated.
scrolly telling narrative is enough.
TODO: site the college majors site


Elina's feedback
-start with the question in the beginning, better introduction: why do people. ask the question: what's the cause of migration
    -talk about stats, why is it important to understand?
-across 2 or 3 steps of scrolly: start with big text (two sentences), photos. then ask question.
    -emphasize with highlights and bolds. highlight keywords and continue to highlight throughout the website.
-Elina likes the first sentence! a lot!
-slim zone of photos
-titles should always be the questions
-conclusion: come back to the question. Too much info in a paragraph. When presenting, people will not get to read all the text.
-change timer to see if it can make the transitions smoother
-function position()
-scr
-1. alphas, 2. forces, 3. collides. check everything works 4. change durations, 
-TODO: change transition from blue to 4 groups
-push bubbles out to side, pull it back in. will make transition a lot better.

-TODO: 
-CSV coded in to d3 and csv in section.js. 
-change in labels: major
