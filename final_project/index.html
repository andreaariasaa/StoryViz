        <h2 id="callout">How does economic opportunity affect migration?</h3>
          <p>
            To be a migrant is to have your life and your story politicized. Fleeing violence or natural disasters,
            seeking economic opportunities, or moving for a new job in a foreign country becomes a political act
            rather
            than a personal one. Over the past decade the number of migrants from Central America to the United States
            has been steadily increasing and unfortunately, prejudice against migrants and fears over “caravans” of
            migrants have been increasing alongside. But who are the migrants? What are their stories? <br><br>

        <h2>The 5000 households</h2>
        <p>Our data comes from a
          <span class="bolded">World Food Bank survey</span>
          of around
          5000 households in <span class="bolded">Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          These 5000 households were asked about their income level, willingness to migrate, and migration plans.
          <br>
          <br>
          Let’s start by diving into the level of financial comfort of the households surveyed.
          <!-- Many of the
          respondents have family members who have migrated, considered migrating, or previously attempted to migrate,
          but many do not. Of those who previously migrated or considered migrating, <span class="bolded">83.4% of
            respondents said their primary
            motivation was to find better job opportunities.</span> -->

        <h2>"Which of these statements is closest to how you feel about your household income these days?"</h2>
        <p>This survey question provides a general picture of the income brackets of our respondents. Let's focus
          in on those who answered <span class="bolded">"we are in a very critical situation with our current
            income."</span></p>

        <h2>"Do you consider that in the last year violence in the place where you live has increased, decreased, or
          stayed the same?</h2>
        <p>
          Here we can see that a minority of the respondents claimed to have experienced no violence or crime at all.
          <br><br>It is even possible that those who responded "Diminished" are still experiencing violence frequently.
          Especially in the case of households with children, this experience <span class="bolded">may play a
            significant role in decision to migrate.</span>

        <h2>"Ideally, if you had the opportunity, would you like to move permanently or for a long period to another
          country?"</h2>
        <p>The number of families seeking to migrate may make sense given the story that is always told of migrants
          fleeing a lack of economic opportunity, though the reality is often that many people at this level of
          instability cannot afford migration.
          <br><br>For those who have attempted to migrate themselves or have family members who have, <span
            class="bolded">the average cost in USD was around $6000.</span>

        <!-- <p> Through this question which ___ families who answered, let’s look at the families who want to migrate and
          see if they feel they are ready to do so.</p> -->
        <p>Here we can see that a lower proportion of households are currently planning to migrate than those who would
          would like to.
          <br><br>This could be due to a range of reasons, but given the high cost of migration and the financial
          vulnerability of this subset, it's <span class="bolded">very likely that financial constraints play a
            role.</span>

        <p>Of the families who want to migrate but are not planning on migrating, there are a variety of stated
          reasons, the most
          common being <span class="bolded">not having enough money to pay for the transfer or to pay for housing in
            another country.</span></p>

        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p>
          Here we can get a sense of how lower income households fare, understand why someone may want to migrate, and
          learn why they may not be able to.
          We can understand <span class="bolded">these stories as more than dots</span> or more than political
          controversy in the US.
          Every dot here is a household with a story and life and we hope to shed a little light on that story.
